# Object detection using deep learning with OpenCV and Python 

OpenCV `dnn` module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch and TensorFlow. 

When it comes to object detection, popular detection frameworks are
 * YOLO
 * SSD
 * Faster R-CNN
 
 Support for running YOLO/DarkNet has been added to OpenCV dnn module recently. 
 
 ## Dependencies
  * opencv
  * numpy
  * flask
  
`pip install numpy opencv-python flask`


 ## YOLO (You Only Look Once)
 
 The weight and the configurations were Downloaded from this [link](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
 
 
 ## Usage :
Run the code.
Open copy and paste - localhost:5000 - in your browser once the server starts running
upload the image you want to detect
